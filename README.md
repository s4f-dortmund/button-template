# Button Template

A LaTeX document to create a page filled with logos ready to
be cut out for buttons.


**<span style="color: crimson">Print without scaling or "Fit to printable area"</span>**

You need two sizes, the size of the actual button (we had 25mm) and the size
of your cutting tool (35.4mm for us).

The optional Argument of the `\buttons` command is the background color.
